Changes since the last public release (1.0.63):

  Fix typecast in a png_debug2() statement in png_set_text_2() to
    avoid a compiler warning in PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Fixed printf formats in pngtest.c to avoid compiler warnings and a
    Coverity warning in PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Avoid Coverity issue 80858 (REVERSE NULL) in pngtest.c PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Removed WRITE_WEIGHTED_FILTERED code.
  Avoid potentially dereferencing NULL info_ptr in png_info_init_3().
  Fixed potential leak of png_pixels in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c
  Use nanosleep() instead of usleep() in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c
    because usleep() is deprecated (port from libpng16).
  Fixed some bad links in the man page.
  Added a safety check in png_set_tIME() (Fixes CVE-2015-7981, bug report
    from Qixue Xiao).
  Prevent writing over-length PLTE chunk (Cosmin Truta).
  Silently truncate over-length PLTE chunk while reading.
  Clarified COPYRIGHT information to state explicitly that versions
    are derived from previous versions.
  Removed much of the long list of previous versions from png.h and
    libpng.3.
